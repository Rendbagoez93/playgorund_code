# Python Practice and Learning Playground

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts and notebooks created for practicing and understanding various Python concepts, libraries, and data analysis techniques. Each file demonstrates different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Structure

- **Comparison_Tool.py**: Tools for comparing data or results.
- **game_with_lsit_of_losts.py**: Practice with lists and game logic.
- **List of Lists.py**: Examples of working with nested lists.
- **Main2.py, Main4.py**: General practice scripts for Python concepts.
- **sales_data.py**: Data cleaning and visualization using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Streamlit. Includes both dashboard and script-based visualizations.
- **Set_of_Sets.py**: Practice with sets and set operations.
- **simple_calculator.py**: Basic calculator implementation in Python.
- **statistic_calculation.py**: Scripts for statistical calculations and analysis.
- **trending_movies.py, trending_movies02.py**: Data analysis and visualization for trending movies datasets.
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files used by the scripts.
    - `raw/`: Original datasets (e.g., sales_data.csv, Trending_Movies.csv)
    - `processed/`: Cleaned or transformed data outputs (e.g., cleaned_sales_data.xlsx)

## How to Use

- Explore each script to learn about different Python concepts and libraries.
- Some scripts (like `sales_data.py`) can be run as a regular Python script or as a Streamlit dashboard for interactive data visualization.
- Data files are provided in the `data/` directory for use with the scripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Common libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, openpyxl, etc.
- Install dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g., `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install ...`).

## Purpose

This directory is intended for experimentation, learning, and hands-on practice with Python. Feel free to modify, extend, or use these scripts for your own learning journey.
